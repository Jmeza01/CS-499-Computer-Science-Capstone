## Self-Assessment
  Completing my coursework throughout the program and developing this ePortfolio has helped to showcase my strengths and understanding of software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. I have also gained important understanding and practice in security, collaborating in a team environment, and the insights of communication within our stakeholders. Specifically in this ePortfolio, I was able to showcase my proficiency in regards to programming in Python, C++, Javascript, and SQL languages.

  During the time I was enrolled in the CS-340 here at SNHU, I was able practice and strenghten solid experience by understanding the importance of collaboration among a team development environment and communicating with our stakeholders. During this course, I was able to assume the role of, as well as work with others assuming the roles of different members of an agile development team. These roles included the scrum master, product owner, tester, and developer. The time spent in that course and the lessons learned really showed me the importance of the different roles of a development team and how crucial it is to work together, by including the communication to stakeholder among the project, whereas it met deadlines and requirements of the project and clients. Overall, from all of the courses that I was enrolled in here at SNHU that were directly related to Computer Science that was very importatnt along with CS 260 - Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and IT 315 - Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOP) gave me a growing understanding of Software Design and Engineering and its general requirements.

  The CS-260 course here at SNHU provided me with a quality understanding of data structures and algorithms. I was introduced to data structures such as Arrays, Sets, Dictionaries or Objects, Linked Lists, Binary Search Tree, Hash Tables, Graphs, and Vector Sorting Algorithms among other programming skills and techniques. Learning and practicing these different types of data structures and algorithms was key to understanding the importance of data organization, store management, and data manipulation in software development and how algorithms are incredibly helpful in saving time, energy, and resources.

  MIT Software Development MERN program I had taken a project of my book library which managed a long list of books to be used in MongoDB, in addition; I used MongDB before in SNHU Bachelor's Degree program under CS-340 Client/Server Development course. Where I found myself understanding better the insights of security and non-relational/relational database management skills. These courses introduced me to working with databases in MongoDB and securing them so only specific users with credentials and authentication tokens were able to access and modify the databases. Being able to work with a database and alter it is a great skill to have, but if there is no security and if anyone who is able to access the database is able to manipulate it, this can become a significant problem. Security is key to safekeeping information in databases, as well as all other aspects of software development, so it needs to be a primary focus with any major project before releasing to the public or anyone who should not have access to manipulate the data or source code to protect the team and intellectual property of the original creators.

   For this ePortfolio, I decided to include three different artifacts â€“ one for each category that was incorporated. Of course, I could have chosen a single artifact to show enhancements for each category, but I felt that using three different would be a good way to break it up and really showcase my skills and deliver better understanding of theses three different categories by software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. The artifacts that I included are from projects that I worked on throughout my enrollment here at SNHU and MIT Software Development MERN program where I had done these type of similar study and work while attending SNHU.

In addition, I had to implement some new arrays to either sort the new elements found within a large data set and place the elements in nodes while they either bubble up or down from the structured tree. Therefore, by using association, I was able to use from the dataset given each object's identification number to find the correct output, but also accurate and expected results of the monthly sales from the large dataset of the company.
