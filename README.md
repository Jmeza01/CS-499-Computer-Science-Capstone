### Please click <a href='https://github.com/Jmeza01/CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone/blob/main/README.md'>Home Page</a> to better understand what are the most important and proud projects that I've built and continously developed over my Computer Science scholar years within the Bachelor's in Science Degree Program.

### Please click <a href='https://youtu.be/gMsfGDs2b3Q'>Code Review</a> to better understand the proposal enhancments that are important and for a developer as myself to keep conscious of what priorities are needed to make a robust application program for our clients to enjoy. 

### Please click <a href='https://github.com/Jmeza01/CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone/tree/main/Software%20Engineering%20and%20Design%20Enhancements'>Software Engineering and Design Enhancements</a> to better understand what new enhancements were made to my original project which was created in Juypter Notebook.py (Python/DASH/NUMPY in MatPlotLib/FLASK/Pandas) from a Client/Server-Side Scripting with Non-Relational MongoDB.

### Please click <a href='https://github.com/Jmeza01/CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone/tree/main/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms'>Data Structures and Algorithms</a> to better understand the proposal enhancements that are important, so I went ahead and modified my Data Structures by applying new algorithms like the Sort() method to increase better performance which provide real-time results while using the Binary Search Tree (BST). In addition, I had to implement some new arrays to either sort the new elements found within a large data set and place the elements in nodes while they either bubble up or down from the structured tree. Therefore, by using association, I was able to use from the dataset given each object's identification number to find the correct output, but also accurate and expected results of the monthly sales from the large dataset of the company.
